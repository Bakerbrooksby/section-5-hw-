        <h1>More Basketball</h1>
    <p>Many fans consider LeBron James better than Michael Jordan because of his unmatched versatility, longevity, and all-around impact on the game. LeBron has dominated the NBA across multiple eras, teams, and playstyles, proving he can excel with any roster and in any system. He’s a more complete player—able to score, rebound, defend multiple positions, and act as one of the greatest passers the league has ever seen. His career longevity is unprecedented, remaining an elite player well into his late 30s, something Jordan never matched. Beyond statistics, LeBron’s ability to elevate teammates, adapt his game, and consistently carry teams deep into the playoffs strengthens the argument that he has had a broader and more sustained influence on winning than Jordan.</p>
    <h1>Who Would Win?</h1>
    <p>n a one-on-one matchup, Kevin Durant would likely beat Stephen Curry because his physical advantages—height, length, and shot-creating ability—are much harder to defend in an isolated setting. Durant is seven feet tall with guard skills, meaning Curry would have difficulty contesting his jumpers, stopping his drives, or preventing him from shooting over the top. While Curry’s quickness, handles, and elite shooting would absolutely keep him competitive and allow him to get hot in stretches, one-on-one basketball favors size and the ability to score without screens. Durant’s combination of size, mobility, and shot-making gives him a clearer edge in a pure iso battle.</p>
